Fuse::TagLayer
==============

A read-only tag-filesystem overlay for hierarchical filesystems

## SYNOPSIS

The Fuse::TagLayer bundle consists of the backend module _Fuse::TagLayer_, which you
probably want to use through the _taglayer_ mounting script:

    taglayer <real directory> <tag directory mountpoint>

## DESCRIPTION

Fuse::TagLayer offers all the tags found in one subdir/volume as a tag-based file-system
at the mountpoint you specify, currently read-only. This is in addition to the real
filesystem which is considered to be 'canonical' - with the tag-file-system being
just another "layer" to access these files (thus the name).

Please note:

This here is only a short github placeholder README. More information about
how to use the mounting script _taglayer_ and the _Fuse::TagLayer_ module can be found
in the POD embedded in the source code. So, please hop over to _cpan_ for canonical the
[documentation](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Fuse%3A%3ATagLayer).
